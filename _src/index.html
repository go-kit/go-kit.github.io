<h3>🚀&nbsp; Adopt Go in your organization.</h3>
<p>
	Go is a lovely little language that's perfectly suited to writing microservices.
	Go kit fills in the gaps left by the otherwise excellent standard library,
	 giving your team the <strong>confidence</strong> to adopt Go throughout your stack.
</p>
</div>
<div class="block">
<h3>🔍&nbsp; Focus on your business logic.</h3>
<p>
	Adopting microservices means building a distributed system, and that comes with a lot of challenges.
	Go kit provides <strong>guidance and solutions</strong> for most of the common operational and infrastructural concerns.
	Allowing you to focus your mental energy on your business.
</p>
</div>
<div class="block">
<h3>😌&nbsp; Few opinions, lightly held.</h3>
<p>
	You know your domain and context better than anyone.
	Go kit is lightly opinionated, and was designed for <strong>interoperability</strong> from day one.
	Use the databases, components, platform, and architecture that works best for you.

<h3>Why Go?</h3>
<p>
	Go is designed from first principles to advance the practice of software engineering.
	It's easy to learn, easy to master, and &mdash; most importantly &mdash; easy to maintain, by large and dynamic teams of engineers.
	And with highly-efficient concurrency, an expansive standard library, and a steadily-improving runtime,
	 it's practically the perfect language for writing microservices.
</p>
</div>
<div class="block">
<h3>Why microservices?</h3>
<p>
	Almost all of contemporary software engineering is focused on the singular goal of improving time-to-market.
	Microservices are an evolution of the service-oriented architecture pattern that elegantly eliminate organizational friction,
	 giving your engineers and teams the autonomy they need to continuously ship, iterate, and improve.
</p>
</div>
<div class="block">
<h3>Why Go kit?</h3>
<p>
	Go is a great general-purpose language, but microservices require a certain amount of specialized support.
	RPC safety, system observability, infrastructure integration, even program design &mdash;
	Go kit fills in the gaps left by the standard library,
	 and makes Go a first-class language for writing microservices in any organization.
